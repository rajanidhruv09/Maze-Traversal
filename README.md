# Maze-Traversal
This repository contains code for the Right Wall following algorithm that is used for Maze Traversal

Requirements to run the program:
  1) Matlab
  2) LEGO Mindstorm EV3
  3) Basic driving base
  4) Ultrasonic, light and touch sensors should be connected to the LEGO brick according to the port specification mentioned below :-
  
      a) Connect right motor to port B
      
      b) Connect left motor to port D
      
      c) Connect ultrasonic sensor to port 1
      
      d) Connect light sensor to port 4
      
      e) Connect touch sensor to port 2
  5) Ensure that the Ultrasonic sensor is pointing towards the right, the touch sensor is attached in front so that when the robot hits the wall the touch sensor is activated, and the light sensor is facing towards the bottom surface of the maze
